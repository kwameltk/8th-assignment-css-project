                I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iPhone I have loved them ever since the
                first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and an awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go
                for
                and work with the apple when I get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and
                make
                Apple greater than before it was. But I Will dearly miss Steve Jobs hes a great man and I will never
                forget
                him.

            As I heard this sad news via iPhone I am emailing my condolence from my MacBook Pro. Steve has left a
            fingerprint on our culture that cannot be rivaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy to his
            family and friends.

            <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
            What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I’ve written as an adult (and certainly every
            one that has been published), almost every email I’ve ever written, has been written on machines created by
            Apple. I interacted online using an Apple Machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to
            realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, I have been able to realize my
            own. You`ll be missed, Mr Jobs. Thanks for all your Amazing work.

            Apart of my heart has cracked. I don’t know him personally but I felt like I knew him. I will forever
            remember him. I’m still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has
            certainly gained an Angel.
